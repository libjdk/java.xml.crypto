[**libjdk**](https://github.com/libjdk/libjdk) is a comprehensive C++ implementation of the Java Development Kit (JDK), providing native C++ libraries that mirror the functionality of Java's core libraries and modules. While it provides Java-like APIs, it runs as native C++ code without requiring a Java Virtual Machine.

## Overview

This project provides a complete C++ implementation of Java's XML Crypto functionality, including:

- XML encryption and decryption
- XML signature creation and verification
- Support for various XML encryption and signature algorithms
- Integration with Java's existing XML APIs
